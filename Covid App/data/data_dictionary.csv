The earlier month of the Clinical Date (date related to the illness or specimen collection) or the Date Received by CDC,case_month,Calculated,"Character, length 7","YYYY-MM; NA, if value suppressed for privacy protection.",ISO 8601,"Quasi-identifier for k-anonymity, k=11.",Month of cdc_case_earliest_dt. Cdc_case_earliest_dt uses the best available date from both cdc_received_dt and cdc_clinical_obs_dt and is an option to end-users who need a date variable with optimized completeness. The logic of cdc_case_earliest_dt is to use the non-null date of one variable when the other is null and to use the earliest valid date when both dates are available.
State of residence,res_state,Case Report Form,"Character, length 2","NA, if value suppressed for privacy protection.",USPS,"Quasi-identifier for k-anonymity, k=11. Suppressed when # cases < 1,000.",Coded to reporting jurisdiction when not provided.

Suppressed when population < 20,000. Suppressed when only single county within state is suppressed and would reveal value, so next smallest county suppressed so at least two counties will be suppressed. Suppressed any time state is suppressed.",Coded to Missing when not provided.

NA, if value suppressed for privacy protection.",,"Quasi-identifier for k-anonymity, k=11. ","The age group value is populated using the age value reported on the case report form. Date of birth is used to fill in missing/unknown age values using the difference in time between date of birth and onset date. Age group category values designed based on epidemiologically meaningful groups and to align with age group categories used by other CDC datasets, visualizations, and publications. 0-17: children and teens (most interactions either at home or at school); 18-49: working age population; 50-64: older working age population (potentially higher risk/more vulnerable); and 65+: older adult population - higher risk for severe outcomes (administrative reason for group: Medicare).

Weeks between earliest date and date of first positive specimen collection,case_positive_specimen_interval,Calculated,Integer,,,,"Calculated by dividing the days between pos_spec_dt and cdc_case_earliest_dt, rounding up. Blank when pos_spec_dt not provided."
Weeks between earliest date and date of symptom onset,case_onset_interval,Calculated,Integer,,,," Calculated by dividing the days between onset_dt and cdc_case_earliest_dt, rounding up. Since cdc_case_earliest_dt is calculated using the earliest of multiple dates, for some records this will mean the cdc_case_earliest_dt and onset_dt are the same and so the interval is 0 and have the same value as cases with 0 week intervals. Blank when onset_dt not provided."
